# rl-visualizations
Simple visualizations of basic RL algorithms in a simple gridworld. Written in Python, in the context of tutoring an RL unit at the University of Bath. The visualizations can be seen directly in the respective jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`-files).

Not maintained at all. But I'm building a series of blog posts ([janmaltel.com/blog](https://www.janmaltel.com/blog/)) building on the simple examples contained in this repo.
